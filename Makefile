# RSHELL LEGACY NOTES
# (using mpremote now instead of rshell so no longer applies)
# ABOUT RSHELL_PORT
# rshell does not recognize the Adafruit rp2040 board being used.
# so the port must be specified through the environment variable
# RSHELL_PORT. Be sure to set it to match your serial device connected
# to the Adafruit board.
# RSHELL NOTES
# initially circuitpython was used. rshell did not work well transferring
# files. there were permission problems and IO errors. The deploym target was
# added that just allows files to be copied to the mounted drive that is
# provided by circuitpython.
# However, rshell to work fine with micropython which is used at the time
# of this writing. And micropython does not automatically mount a drive to
# expose the filesystem.

"""cmdclasses - Import all command classes so they can be easily referenced.

Any class that implements a command is added here in the form of:

``` py
from mycommand import MyCommand
```

This allows the class `MyCommand` to be referenced directly. It makes the `add`
command possible so that the user can type the class name.

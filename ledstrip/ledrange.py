"""range (LedRange) - set range of pixels to a color.

This command is used to set a range of one or more pixels to a fixed color. The
format is:

    $range,<start-pixel>,<num-pixels>,<color1>,<color2>,<color3>

* start-pixel - the starting pixel number (0-origin) of the range
* num-pixels  - the number of pixels to include in the range
* color1/2/3  - the value of each of the three color fields, 0-255

The color format is usually RGB or GRB. You can experiment setting each in turn
to see how they are mapped with your hardware.

The main purpose of this command is for prototyping and debugging. Once a
pattern is defined, it should be implemented as a new command class in this
code.

*Example*

Set pixels 10-19 to blue at half intensity:

    $range,10,10,0,0,128

The `range` command does not have any configuration settings.
